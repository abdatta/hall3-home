  <p>The Hall Canteen is perhaps the best place to hang out with wingies and friends. The timing of the canteen wiz. 2:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. is possibly the best gift to an engineering student! Whether you miss a meal in mess, just want an evening snack or are tired after long hours of study for the exams, delicious food shall always await you in the canteen!</p>
