  <h1>Mess</h1>

  <p>Health is the greatest wealth! Following the same mantra, the hall mess serves one of the finest qualities of food with the lowest possible prices. Apart from the basic nutritional diet, one can always get an ‘extra’ made or grab a glass of juice on his/her way out. The cost effective ‘Baskin-Robins’ ice-cream is always a delicious treat too. The mess menu is updated regularly based on the season and the feedback received. Since learning from feedback is an essential part of growth, one can freely express his/her views in the ‘Feedback Register’ kept at the mess cash counter.</p>
