  <h1>Students’ Activity Committee</h1>
  <div class="space-20"></div>
  <p>The Students’ Activity Committee is a team of student volunteers who are responsible for the overall conductance of the intra and inter-hostel co-curricular events. These volunteers work hard to plan and execute each and every small action required for the students’ co-curricular events. It is because of volunteers like these that the prodigious culture of Hall-3 has been passed over the years.</p>
