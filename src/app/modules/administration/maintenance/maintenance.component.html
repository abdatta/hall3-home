  <h1>Maintenance Committee</h1>
  <div class="space-20"></div>
  <p>The Maintenance Committee is a team of student volunteers who are accountable for the overall maintenance of the hall. In case you find a certain issue with the maintenance of your room or a common room or with any other part of the Hall, in case the workers deny to clean your room without a valid reason or if you have a suggestion for the Hall maintenance or beautification, feel free to contact any member of this committee. Also, donâ€™t forget to praise the committee when you find the Hall beautiful and well-maintained!</p>
